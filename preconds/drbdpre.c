/*    Preconditioner Tools for Reaction-Transport Problems */
/*    Part I: Block-Diagonal Reaction-Based Factor without Grouping */
/*                        14 September 1995 */

/* The following three subroutines -- DMSET2, DRBDJA, DRBDPS -- */
/* are provided to assist in the generation and solution of */
/* preconditioner matrices for problems arising from reaction-transport */
/* systems, as solved with DASPK.  More specifically, they are intended */
/* as tools for preconditioners that include a contribution from the */
/* reaction terms of the system.  These are intended as auxiliary */
/* routines for the user-supplied routines JAC and PSOL called by */
/* DASPK when the Krylov method is selected. */

/* These routines are intended for a DAE system obtained from a system */
/* of reaction-transport PDEs, in which some of the PDE variables obey */
/* evolution equations, and the rest obey algebraic (time-independent) */
/* equations.  See Ref. 2, Section 4.  It is assumed that the */
/* right-hand sides of all the equations have the form of a sum of a */
/* reaction term R and a transport term S, that the transport term */
/* is discretized by finite differences, and that in the spatial */
/* discretization the PDE variables at each spatial point are kept */
/* together.  Thus the DAE system function, in terms of a dependent */
/* variable vector u, has the form */
/*     G(t,u,u') = I_d u' - R(t,u) - S(t,u) ,  where */
/*     I_d = identity matrix with zeros in the positions corresponding */
/*           to the algebraic components, ones in those for the */
/*           evolution (differential) components. */
/*     R(t,u) = the reaction terms (spatial coupling absent), and */
/*     S(t,u) = the spatial transport terms. */

/* As shown in [2], two possible preconditioners for such a system are: */
/* (a) P_R = c I_d - dR/du, based on the reaction term R alone, and */
/* (b) P_SR = (I - (1/c) dS/du) (c I_d - dR/du), the product of two */
/*     factors (in either order), one being P_R and the other being */
/*     based on the spatial term S alone. */
/* Here c is the scalar CJ that is input to the JAC and PSOL routines */
/* provided by the user (1/c is proportional to the step size H). */

/* The routines given here can be used to provide the reaction-based */
/* factor P_R.  More precisely, they provide an approximation A_R to */
/* P_R.  The matrix P_R is block-diagonal, with each block corresponding */
/* to one spatial point.  In A_R, we compute each block by difference */
/* quotient approximations, by way of calls to a user-supplied routine, */
/* subroutine RBLOCK, that evaluates the reaction terms at a single */
/* spatial point.  A_R has one such block for each spatial point in */
/* the mesh.  (For a more economical approximation, see Part II, */
/* on block-grouping in A_R.) */

/* The routines given here are specialized to the case of a 2-D problem */
/* on a rectangular mesh in the x-y plane.  However, they can be easily */
/* modified for a different problem geometry.  It is also assumed */
/* that the PDE variables are ordered so that the differential */
/* variables appear first, followed by the algebraic variables. */

/* To make use of these routines in a DASPK solution, the user must */
/* provide: */
/* (a) a calling program that sets the DASPK input parameters, and calls */
/*     DMSET2 to set mesh data and mesh-related DASPK inputs; */
/* (b) a JAC routine, as prescribed by the DASPK instructions, which */
/*     calls DRBDJA, and does any other Jacobian-related preprocessing */
/*     needed for preconditioning; and */
/* (c) a PSOL routine, as prescribed by the DASPK instructions, which */
/*     calls DRBDPS for the solution of systems A_R x = b, and does */
/*     any other linear system solving required by the preconditioner. */
/* Detailed descriptions and instructions are given below. */

/* In addition, the use of these routines requires: */
/*  * the LINPACK routines DGEFA and DGESL for dense linear sytems, and */
/*  * the machine constant routine D1MACH for the machine unit roundoff. */

/* (a) The calling program. */
/* The calling program sets the DASPK inputs and makes calls to DASPK. */
/* Here the DASPK inputs include */
/*   INFO(12) = 1 [to signal the Krylov method] */
/*   INFO(15) = 1 [to signal the presence of a JAC routine] */

/* Also, the use of the DRBDJA/DRBDPS routines in conjunction with */
/* DASPK requires that certain mesh-related data be set.  This can be */
/* done with the call */
/*     CALL DMSET2 (MX, MY, NS, NSD, LID, IWORK) */
/* The input arguments to DMSET2 are: */
/*   MX and MY = the mesh dimensions. */
/*   NS  = number of PDE variables. */
/*   NSD = number of differential PDE variables. */
/*   LID = offset in IWORK for array showing the differential and */
/*         algebraic components on input to DASPK, required if either */
/*         INFO(11) = 1 or INFO(16) = 1.  Set LID = 0 otherwise. */
/*         If this array is required, set LID = 40 or 40 + NEQ, */
/*         depending on the value of the constraint option INFO(10). */
/* DMSET2 loads mesh data in a COMMON block /DRPRE1/ used by the */
/* DRBDJA/DRBDPS routines. */

/* DMSET2 also loads the preconditioner work lengths into */
/* IWORK(27) and IWORK(28), and if LID > 0 it sets the ID array */
/* in IWORK showing the differential and algebraic components. */

/* (b) The JAC routine. */
/* The user-supplied JAC routine called by DASPK with the Krylov */
/* method specified, is to generate and preprocess Jacobian-related */
/* data as needed for later solution of the preconditioner system */
/* P x = b.  Assuming that P is to be an approximation of either P_R */
/* or P_SR, the JAC routine should call DRBDJA for the approximation */
/* A_R to P_R.  Subroutine DRBDJA generates A_R using difference */
/* quotients.  It then performs an LU decomposition of each block, */
/* using the LINPACK routine DGEFA. */

/* In terms of the arguments passed to JAC by DASPK, the call to */
/* DRBDJA should have the form */
/*     CALL DRBDJA (T, U, R0, RBLOCK, WK, REWT, CJ, WP, IWP, IER) */
/* where we use U instead of Y for the dependent variable array. */
/* The argument R0 is an array assumed to contain the current value */
/* of the R vector, at the current values (T,U).  This can be done, for */
/* example, by taking R0 to be RPAR, and loading RPAR with the */
/* vector R in the last call to the RES routine; in that case, the */
/* calling program must declare RPAR to have length at least NEQ. */
/* Alternatively, insert a call to RBLOCK (see below) within the */
/* loop over mesh points in DRBDJA. */

/* To use DRBDJA, the user must provide the following subroutine, */
/* which DRBDJA calls to obtain individual blocks of R: */
/*      SUBROUTINE RBLOCK (T, JX, JY, UXY, RXY) */
/* The input arguments to RBLOCK are: */
/*   T     = current time. */
/*   JX,JY = spatial indices in x- and y-directions. */
/*   UXY   = block of NS dependent variables at spatial point (JX,JY). */
/* RBLOCK is to load block (JX,JY) of R(t,u) into the array RXY. */

/* (c) The PSOL routine. */
/* The user-supplied PSOL routine must solve the linear system P x = b, */
/* where P is the preconditioner matrix.  For this, the PSOL routine */
/* should call DRBDPS for the solution of A_R.  Subroutine DRBDPS */
/* solves a linear system A_R x = b, using the LINPACK backsolve */
/* routine DGESL.  In terms of the arguments passed to PSOL by DASPK, */
/* the call to DRBDPS should have the form */
/*     CALL DRBDPS (B, WP, IWP) */
/* DRBDPS overwrites the B array (containing b) with the solution x. */
